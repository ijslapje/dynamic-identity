There were around 5 different concepts carried out, the final ones are here with concept 1 and concept 2. Find in the files and play around with it if needed! Cheers!
Concept 1 - the final concept that is utilised. The user is able to interact in a conversation form with the building itself. While the top layer looks like a normal conversation that is superficial, the deeper meaning behind it is much more, where the building is trying to unconsciously put in some degree of mindfulness, taking that heavy burden emotions or feelings away from the user while holding the conversation.
Concept 1 - visual 2 - this is just another visualisation for the concept 1.
Concept 2 - this concept let the user interact with their thoughts. When the installation caught the userâ€™s thoughts, it lets the user visualise their thoughts on the wall, making them able to see usually invisible stuffs, and that connection would be more tangible and real. After about few seconds, the thoughts dissolve and user is able to interact with the thought bubble itself. The meaning behind is that the user accept, and even feel playful with their thoughts, that all thoughts, positive or bad, are fine, let it be, let it be.
