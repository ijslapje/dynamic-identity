To run the code you need to have Processing 4 installed. You can donwload it from here: https://processing.org/download
For my specific project you also need to have the Processing sound library installed. 
You can do this by going to Sketch --> Import Library --> Add Library. Then search up Sound. Click on the Sound library
and press install. You can do this same thing to install the minim and serial libraries

At the current moment the code goes from one state to the other via a mouseclick. Do not spamclick but always wait
for voicelines to finish or else they will play over each other.
For any questions or errors or unclarities you run into, mail the original creator of the code: riangelochristie@gmail.com
